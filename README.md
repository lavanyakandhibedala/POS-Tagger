To Run the program, follow the instructions give below:
1. First copy the zip file into your system.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Open an CMD with Admin rights.
4. Change Directory to the file location included.
5. Compile and Excute the POS_tagging java file.

The output.txt file is the final output file.

Parts-of-speech tagging is also called as grammatical tagging or word category disambiguation. In this process, the marking up a word in a text as corresponding to a particular part-of-speech, based on both its definition, as well as its content i.e.; relationship with adjacent and related words in a phrase, sentence or paragraph. 
Parts-of-Speech tagging is harder than just having a list of words and their parts of speech, because some words can represent more than one part of speech at different times, and because some not rare-in natural languages, a large percentage of word forms are ambiguous.POS tagging is now done in the context of computational linguistics using algorithms which fall into two distinctive groups:
									i.	Rule-Based
									ii.	Stochastic
Rule-Based Model: It is a approach that uses a set of rules that specifies a mathematical model. The set of rules can either be translated into markov chains or differential equations. 
Stochastic Model: A stochastic model is a tool for estimating probability distributions of potential outcomes by allowing variations in one or more inputs over time.
To test the model, we take an article as the data set for the model being developed.
