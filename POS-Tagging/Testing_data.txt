On the inflation front, the RBI has drawn reassurance from the fact that food inflation eased in the second half of the last financial year, notably as a result of a decline in prices and not as a result of the base effect. The central bank expects retail inflation to continue to decelerate and remain around 5 per cent this year. And showing that it has not dropped its guard against incipient price pressures, the monetary authority flagged uncertainties such as historic lows in reservoir levels, the recent upturn in prices of commodities, especially oil, and the impact of the implementation of the Seventh Central Pay Commission’s recommendations, all meriting close watch. Dr. Rajan is convinced that improved monetary transmission holds the key to unlocking credit. To that end, the move to a marginal cost of funds based lending rate regime has already helped pare borrowing costs by at least 25 to 50 basis points, according to initial estimates of the RBI. The coming months will tell if Dr. Rajan’s pointed efforts to clean up banks’ balance sheets will also help augment funds availability in the real economy.
